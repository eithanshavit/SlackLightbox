# SlackLightbox

This is an exercise to create a pure JavaScript lightbox.

This lightbox features a full screen aspect-cover image, and a real-time search box. When keywords are typed in the search box, 10 images are queried with Google Images and displayed. The left and right arrow keyboard keys navigate between the displayed images.

### TODO
Since this is an exercise the feature set is limited. Here are some ideas for improvements:

* Add paging to fetch more photos when user nears end of buffer
* Create intuitive buttons for mouse navigation
* Auto focus for search box
* Smarter image preloader
* Responsive design
